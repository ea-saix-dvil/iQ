# Ikigai (生き甲斐) is a Japanese concept that means "reason for being" or "purpose in life."

Ikigai is the intersection of four things:

- What you love
- What you are good at
- What the world needs
- What you can be paid for

Ikigai is not about finding a perfect job or career, but rather about finding activities that give your life meaning and purpose. It can be anything from spending time with loved ones, volunteering in your community, or pursuing a hobby that you are passionate about.

Ikigai is often associated with longevity and well-being. Studies have shown that people who have a strong sense of ikigai tend to be happier and healthier, and live longer.

Here are some tips for finding your ikigai:

- Think about what you are passionate about. What activities make you lose track of time? What do you enjoy doing even when you are not being paid?
- Consider your skills and talents. What are you good at? What do you have to offer the world?
- Look for ways to use your skills and talents to help others. What kind of work would make you feel like you are making a difference?
- Don't be afraid to experiment. It may take some time to find your ikigai, so try different things and see what feels right for you.

Ikigai is a journey, not a destination. It is something that you discover and develop over time. As you grow and change, your ikigai may change as well. So be open to new possibilities and enjoy the journey.

## The Inspiration for iQ

> Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in Neal Stephenson's science fiction novel The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer. Set in a future where technology has advanced significantly, one of the most important ways AI is used in the novel is to provide equitable standards of education to characters of marginalized identities. In the book, AI-powered tutors called "primers" are made available to every student regardless of their economic status. These personalized education devices adapt to the individual needs of each student to provide instruction in any subject area, and also create customized stories and simulations to help students learn.  One of the characters in the novel, a young girl named Nell, uses her primer to obtain an expansive education including learning about her cultural identity and feeding her personal curiousity to develop her own unique skills and talents.
